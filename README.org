#+TITLE: Nomad: Portable Habitations in OCaml's Dunes

A tiny, minimally functional project launcher (maybe more general utility) for
OCaml, coordinating [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune][Dune]], opam, and other tooling in the ecosystem.

* Install

Assuing you have installed [[https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Using-your-distribution-39-s-package-system][opam]]  and [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune#installation][dune]]:

#+begin_src sh
opam pin git@github.com:shonfeder/nomad.git
#+end_src

* Usage

** Create a new project to build a binary

If you project's name is =dingus=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nomad new dingus
#+END_SRC

And a scaffold for building the dingus executable will be created in the
directory =./dingus=.

** Create a new project to build a library

If you project's name is =dingus=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nomad new --lib dingus
#+END_SRC

And a scaffold for building the dingus library will be created in the
directory =./dingus=.

** Sync the dependencies of a project

From the project root

#+begin_src
nomad sync
#+end_src

And the dependencies declared in your project's =dune-project= will be synced
using opam.

** Examples

For more examples of usage, see [[file:test/README.org][test/README.org]].
