#+TITLE: Nomad: Portable Habitations in OCaml's Dunes

A tiny, minimally functional project launcher (maybe more general utility) for
OCaml, using [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune][Dune]].
* Install

  1. [[https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Using-your-distribution-39-s-package-system][Install opam]].
  2. [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune#installation][Install dune]] (formerly "jbuilder")
  3. Clone this repo, build,and install
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone https://github.com/shonfeder/nomad.git
    cd nomad
    jbuilder build @install && jbuilder install
    #+END_SRC

* Usage
** Create a new project that will build to a binary
   If you project's name is =dingus=
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   nomad.exe --bin dingus
   #+END_SRC
   And a template to being writing and building dingus will be created in the
   directory =./dingus=.
** Create a new project that will build to a library
   If you project's name is =dingus=
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   nomad.exe --lib dingus
   #+END_SRC
   And a template to being writing and building dingus will be created in the
   directory =./dingus=.

* Plans

  Depending on how dune develops, this tool might mercifully be obviated. In the
  meantime, you can see my [[https://github.com/shonfeder/nomad/blob/master/project.org][project.org]] for some plans and ideas.
